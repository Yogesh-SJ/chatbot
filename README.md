## 🎙️ Q&A System with Google Palm and LangChain

This project builds a Q&A system that uses the power of Google Palm and LangChain ⛓️ to provide instant answers to your questions . It aims to reduce the need for manual responses by leveraging a pre-built knowledge base of FAQs . The system boasts a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, making it easy for anyone to interact and get quick answers .

**Here's what it offers:**

-   **FAQ-Based Knowledge Base:** Loads and processes real FAQs from a handy CSV file .
-   **Vector Database:** Utilizes FAISS (super-fast retrieval!) and Huggingface embeddings for efficient data retrieval .
-   **Streamlit Interface:** A clean and simple UI for easy interaction. Just type your question and get instant answers! ⌨️➡️
-   **Google Palm LLM:** Leverages Google's powerful language model to generate accurate and informative answers .

**How to Use It:**

1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
2.  Add your Google API key to the `.env` file (it's like a secret handshake ).
3.  Run the app with `streamlit run main.py` 🪄.
4.  Click "Create Knowledgebase" to build your super-powered vector database ⚡.
5.  Type your questions in the app and get instant answers! That's it!

**Project Structure:**

-   `main.py`: The main script that runs the Streamlit application.
-   `langchain_helper.py`: Handles LangChain logic and manages the vector database.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies needed.
